# ECE484_Final_Kids_BopGame

Game name: "Bonk That!"

Proposal:
The main goal of this project is to create a kids toy that will be similar to bop it and simon says.  The plan is for there to be four buttons allong with four LEDs.  A LED will randomly light up and the player needs to press the corresponding button within a short timeframe.  If the player doesn't, the game will end.  Given this is accomplished, I plan to decrease the amount of time between light ups and button presses to increase the difficulty as the player continues to play.  Another feature would be to add an LCD to display how many presses they have gotten during that game and an end game screen.

Post Project:
I was able to implement all for buttons and LEDs that I had planned.  I also accomplished the increasaing difficulty and LCD.  Overall, I wish I could have added a speaker to give commands as to which button should be pressed instead of a different tone played on a buzzer.  The buzzer was still a step up from what I was invisoning for this project though.
